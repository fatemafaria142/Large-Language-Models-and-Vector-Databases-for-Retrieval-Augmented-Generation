# Vector Database

A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and manage vectors, which are mathematical representations of data. In the context of this database, a "vector" refers to a numerical array that represents a point in a multi-dimensional space. Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute of the object being represented.

## Overview

Vector databases play a crucial role in various fields such as machine learning, data science, natural language processing, and computer vision. They efficiently store and retrieve vector representations, facilitating tasks like similarity search, machine learning model training, and handling large datasets.

## Applications

### Similarity Search

Finding objects in the database that are similar to a given query vector. This is useful in recommendation systems, image retrieval, and other similarity-based tasks.

### Machine Learning

Storing and retrieving vector representations of data for training machine learning models. Vector databases can efficiently handle large datasets, enhancing the performance of machine learning workflows.

### Natural Language Processing

Storing word embeddings or document embeddings for tasks like text similarity, document retrieval, and sentiment analysis.

### Computer Vision

Managing and retrieving feature vectors for images, facilitating tasks like image recognition and object detection.
