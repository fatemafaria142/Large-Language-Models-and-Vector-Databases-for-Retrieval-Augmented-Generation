# Vector Database

A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and manage vectors, which are mathematical representations of data. In the context of this database, a "vector" refers to a numerical array that represents a point in a multi-dimensional space. Each dimension in the vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute of the object being represented.

## Overview

Vector databases play a crucial role in various fields such as machine learning, data science, natural language processing, and computer vision. They efficiently store and retrieve vector representations, facilitating tasks like similarity search, machine learning model training, and handling large datasets.
